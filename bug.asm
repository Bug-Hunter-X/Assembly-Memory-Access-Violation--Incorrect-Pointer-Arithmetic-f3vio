mov eax, [ebx + 4*ecx]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by ebx + 4*ecx.  However, if the value of ebx + 4*ecx is not a valid memory address (e.g., it points outside the allocated memory space, or it's not properly aligned), this will lead to a segmentation fault or other memory access violation.  This is a common error when working with array indices and pointers.  Another subtle problem might be if ecx holds a value unexpectedly large leading to an address far beyond the intended memory region.
